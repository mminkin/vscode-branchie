# Branchie

From the creators of Yammer, the best workplace social media network - Branchie, a small but fierce [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mminki.branchie).

## Features

Branchie will help you remember where you left off by showing you files you already commited to the branch and files you opened last time you worked in it.

## Requirements

Git based repository.

## Known Issues

This a hacky hack, so all the issues.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

This hackweeek we're doubling down on smoother context-switching.

- Hexed the modified and staged views because VSCode does it better anyway!
- Added a branch aware "session manager". Every branch checkout will save your open tabs so when you come back they'll open back up.

### 0.2.0

Another hackweek, another round of improvements!

### 0.0.0

Grand unraveling of Branchie.

**Enjoy!**
